    <span>SOCIAL SERVICES GROUP LIABILITY PROGRAM ELIGIBILITY</span>
</div>
<div mat-dialog-content>
    <p>All programs are encouraged to secure liability insurance for their volunteers and are advised to seek legal advice regarding
        risks and liabilities associated with implementing and operating a program.</p>

    <p>There are several ways that your organization can obtain liability insurance:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            If your program is part of an umbrella organization, your volunteers may be eligible for coverage under its master policy.
        </li>
        <li>
            If your volunteers report directly to a municipal employee or a municipal contractor, coverage may be available through
            the municipality’s insurance.
        </li>
        <li>
            If your organization is affiliated with an agency that is under contract to the province, it may already be covered by
            government’s Social Services Group Liability Program (SSGLP).
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>It may be in the best interest of programs to seek accident coverage, commonly called Accidental Death and Disability
        (AD&D), for their volunteers. If this coverage is desired, it is up to the funding recipient to arrange for it through the
        commercial insurance market.</p>

    <p><strong>SOCIAL SERVICES GROUP LIABILITY PROGRAM</strong></p>

    <p>The Social Services Group Liability (SSGLP) coverage provides $2,000,000 per occurrence of commercial general liability
        insurance. The program is similar to a group insurance program in that all members of the group share similar
        characteristics and can therefore be covered under one policy. The Province provides this coverage to eligible contractors at
        no cost. If service providers feel this limit is not adequate, they can purchase excess coverage from the commercial
        insurance market, usually at a reasonable cost.</p>

    <p>Community Accountability Programs have been offered coverage through SSGLP to help volunteer-based programs get
        started. SSGLP is not designed to replace commercial insurance nor to cover interests that should be insured elsewhere, and
        some programs may have ‘outgrown’ their eligibility for this coverage.</p>

        <li>
            Contracts that include incidental professional services in the context of a larger engagement for non-professional services

            claims will be covered by SSGLP
